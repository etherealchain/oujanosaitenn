Red: Pikachu!! Where are you??
Red: It's so dark here, I wish I had a Charmander...
We need fire; please search for twig
There should be some near the entrance
Red: We shouldn't go deep into the forest before we have fire...
Red: OK, this should work!
Please search for Pikachu
It lives deep in the forest
Red: Pikachu! Here here~
Red: It's not working... if only I had a berry...
Please search for a berry
There should be some near the exit
Red: Got it!
Use the Space key to put the berry near Pikachu
Red: Pikachu~ I got a delicious berry~
Red: Maybe he is afraid of me...
Please leave Pikachu alone
Red: OK, good Pikachu, you must be hungry~
Red: ...!?...
Red: That is... Spearow!? Get down! Pikachu!!
