Green: Well, it has nothing to do with you...
Red: That's it! The League! Let's finish there!
Green: Huh??
Red: Finish our battle! At Indigo Plateau, Pokemon Stadium!!
Red: At the end of our journey, let's finish everything there!
Green: ...You? League?... Do you realize you'll never be able to keep that promise?
Red: Don't worry about it, I'm going to travel too
Red: Through the journey I will become stronger, I will gather 8 badges to enter the League and beat you!!
Red: I WILL become the Pokemon Master!!!
Green: ......
Green: Okay
